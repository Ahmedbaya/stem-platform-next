This directory contains algorithm implementations for the STEM platform, particularly optimization algorithms used in competitions.

## IBMOLS (Iterated Best Improvement Multi-Objective Local Search)

The IBMOLS implementation provides a Python version that exactly replicates the C algorithm behavior for multi-objective knapsack problems (MOKP).

### Key Features
- Exact data loading from standard MOKP file formats
- C-compatible random number generation
- Precise local search logic matching C implementation
- Archive management without Python bounds checking
- Target performance: 800-1200+ Pareto solutions
